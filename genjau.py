#Python Version 2 code 
#The SI4703 reads starting at address 0x0A and starts writing to 0x02

#MANY THANKS to Nathan Seidle and his sketch example code at Sparkfun! I would have been lost without it.

#Here is the SI4703 Datasheet that explains the registers

#This is not finished code and needs a lot of work. I just wanted to prove it can 
#work with the smbus to control the SI4703 2-wire interface. This code is just
#a proof of concept and really junk!

#Anytime you READ the regsters it writes the command byte to the first byte of the 
#SI4703 0x02 register. And then uses the list to write the 2nd bytes of register 0x02
#and continues until all the list is written!

#So the reg = i2c.read_i2c_block_data(address, zz, 32)  command
#writes the integer zz to the first byte of register 0x02.
# so after setting the first byte of 0x02 to what you want it to be you need to 
#make sure every write or read keeps populating that byte with what you need there
